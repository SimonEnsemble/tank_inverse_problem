# reconstructing the shape of a solid in a draining tank from its liquid level dynamics

`tank_problem.jl` is the Julia code (a Pluto notebook) to reproduce the figures in our article:
> G. Fabusola, C. Simon. "Reconstructing the shape of a solid inside a draining tank from its liquid level dynamics." (2024)
this notebook is documented and reads liquid level data from tank drainage experiments in the `.csv` files.

`Water_level_measurement_Audrino.ino` contains the Arduino code to read data from our liquid level sensor.
