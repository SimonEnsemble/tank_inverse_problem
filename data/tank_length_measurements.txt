Cory's measurements of the tank.
instrument = pink tape from Gbenga.

## total height (slanted, from inside bottom to top to just before lip)
H* = 28.6 cm

## hole
H_hole = 2.5 cm

2 * r_hole = 1/8 in # drill bit diameter, confirmed by ruler.

## top (from the inside, BEFORE the top "lip" starts. so not the very top.
L_t = 14.6 cm
W_t = 9.0 cm
perimeter = 44.3 cm

## bottom (from the inside)
L_b = 13.4 cm
W_b = 7.8 cm
perimeter = 40.1 cm

note, for measuring perimeters, I used tape on the side.

# calcs of area

treating the cross-section as a rounded rectangle:
https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RoundedRectangle.html
p = 2(a + b + pi r) # perimeter
 where my measurements are:
 L = a + 2 r
 W = b + 2 r

so in terms of my measurements:
p = 2(L + W - 4 r + pi r)

then we can solve for r consistent with the perimeter we measure:
(pi - 4) r = p / 2 - (L + W)

r  = [p / 2 - (L + W)] / (pi - 4)

and use the formula for the area:
A = ab + 2 r (a + b) + pi r^2
  ... in terms of my measurements:
  = (L-2r)(W-2r)+2r(L+W-4r) + pi r^2

my calcs in Pluto notebook.

## handling slants
liquid level strip is on side.
so we draw a triangle. hypotenuse is H*. other side is H, other side is (L_t-L_b)/2
apply Porthagenean theorem to get H.
