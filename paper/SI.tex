\section{Obtaining Torricelli's Law from Bernoulli's Equation}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\textwidth}

\end{wrapfigure}

	Consider an open-top tank, nearly filled with liquid and with a small hole in its side that allows liquid to flow out of the tank to the atmosphere. 
	At some moment in time, we wish to find the velocity $v_2$ [m/s] at which the liquid ejects from the side of the tank, when the height of the liquid above the center of the hole is $z$ [m].
	
	To do so, we follow Bird, Stewart, and Lightfoot \cite{bsl_book} by applying Bernoulli's equation to two points in the liquid: 
	(1) a point just below the surface of the liquid at the top of the tank, near the center of the tank, and 
	(2) a point inside the outlet stream, just outside of the tank and near the center of the cross-section. 
	 Conceptually, we're considering a typical streamline of the flow extending from point (1) to point (2).
	We make three approximations: 
	(1) the flow along this streamline is at steady-state, which is a quasi-steady-state assumption that $z$ is approximately constant (despite dropping slowly),
	(2) the liquid is inviscid (neglecting frictional forces),
	and
	(3) the liquid is incompressible (constant density $\rho$ kg/m$^3$).
	(Also, the flow is isothermal.)
	
	A mechanical energy balance then implies Bernoulli's equation holds for the two points, which relates the velocity $v_i$ [m/s], pressure $P_i$ [N/m$^2$ $[=]$ kg$\cdot$ /(s$^2\cdot$m)], and elevation $y_i$ [m] of the liquid at the two points $i\in\{1,2\}$:
	\begin{equation}
	g y_1 + \frac{1}{2} v_1^2 + \frac{P_1}{\rho} = gy_2 + \frac{1}{2} v_2^2 + \frac{P_2}{\rho} 
	\end{equation}
	where $g$ [m/s$^2$] is the gravitational acceleration constant. 
	
	Now, since both points are at atmospheric pressure, $P_1=P_2$. And, we have $y_1-y_2=z$. Approximating $v_1\approx 0$ given the cross-sectional area of the liquid at the top of the tank is large relative to the size of the hole in the side of the tank, Bernoulli's equation reduces to:
	\begin{equation}
	g z  = \frac{1}{2} v_2^2,
	\end{equation}
	which states that the potential energy change of the liquid from point (1) to (2) matches the kinetic energy change. I.e., gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. Solving for $v_2$ gives Torricelli's law:
	\begin{equation}
	v_2 = \sqrt{2gz}.
	\end{equation}
