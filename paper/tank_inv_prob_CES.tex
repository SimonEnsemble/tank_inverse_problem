\begin{abstract}
We aim to reconstruct the shape of an exogenous, heavy solid contained in a tank from measurements of the liquid level in the tank as it drains (driven by gravity) through a small orifice in its side. (Because the solid displaces liquid, the rate of decrease of the liquid level provides information about the cross-sectional area of the solid at that height; as the liquid level drops, it ``scans’' the area of the solid as a function of height.) We combine mathematical modeling, Bayesian statistical inversion, Monte Carlo simulation, and wet experiments of a tank draining of water to demonstrate and test our ability to infer the cross-sectional area of the exogenous solid as a function of height. In our experiment, the posterior distribution over the [held-out] shape of the solid (a bottle) agreed reasonably well with our length-measurements ($<$10\% mean reconstruction error on its radius). Our approach may be practically useful to non-destructively characterize the geometry of an unknown solid, or a packed bed of solid particles, contained in an opaque tank.

\section{Introduction}
In engineering and applied sciences, we often encounter a \emph{draining tank}:
an open-top tank that contains liquid and has a small orifice through which liquid flows to the atmosphere, driven by gravity.
Mathematical models of the dynamics of the liquid level in a draining tank are useful for designing the tank and orifice geometry, predicting emptying times, forecasting outlet flow rates, controlling the liquid level by manipulating an input stream, and inferring the liquid level from the outlet flow rate \cite{d2021torricelli,seborg2016process,groetsch1993inverse_tl,groetsch1999inverse}.

\begin{mytcbox}[label=box:waterclocks, breakable]{Ancient water clocks}
Interestingly, ancient societies (e.g.\ ancient Greece) exploited the empirically predictable dynamics of the water level in a draining tank to measure and display the passage of time.
Specifically, the outflow \emph{clepsydra}, Greek for ``water thief'', was an open-top container with a small hole near its bottom and graduated markings on the inside. 
Filled with water then allowed to drain, the elapsed time was indicated by the liquid level with respect to the markings on the inside. \cite{bedini1962compartmented,hwang2021historical,ritner2016oriental,hejun1987research,schomberg2018karnak,mills1982newton}
The preserved Karnak clepsydra from $\sim$1300 BC \cite{schomberg2018karnak} is an inverted, truncated cone. Notably, this geometry does not provide a constant rate of decrease in the water level; perhaps, though, its wider top was intended to compensate for faster outflow when the water level is higher. An inverse problem pertaining to an outflow clepsydra is: what container shape provides a constant rate of decrease in the water level as it drains?
(Such a container may be obtained via a solid of revolution about the vertical axis such that the radius increases with the quartic root of the height. \cite{mills1982newton,d2021torricelli})
\end{mytcbox}
%Draining tanks have been studied since ancient times, as evidenced by water clocks in ancient Egypt, Greece, India, and China.
%The water clock, or clepsydra (Greek for ''water thief''), of the outflow design consisted of an open-top container, filled with water at some reference time, with a small orifice for outflow near its bottom.

%The geometry of an ideal clepsydra would produce a constant rate of decrease in the liquid level. However, the geometry of e.g. the preserved Karnak clepsydra from $\sim$1300 BC \cite{schomberg2018karnak}, an inverted truncated cone, does not. Though, perhaps, its wider top was intended to compensate for the faster outflow when the liquid level is higher.

% Italian physicist and mathematician 
Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647) made a fundamental observation for mathematically modeling the liquid level in a draining tank: 
the velocity $v$ at which liquid flows out of the orifice is proportional to the square root of the height of liquid above the orifice, $z$, i.e. $v\propto \sqrt{z}$ \cite{mills1982newton,dorfman1958life}.
% TODO: check that he didn't know g!
Today, we recover Torricelli's observation by applying Bernoulli's (1700–1782) equation \cite{welty2020fundamentals} to a streamline of the flow of liquid from (1) a point at the top of the liquid inside the tank to (2) a point in the outlet stream just outside of the orifice. 
Bernoulli's equation is a mechanical energy balance along this flow streamline, approximating the liquid as ideal (incompressible and inviscid) and the flow as at steady-state. 
This gives \emph{Torricelli's law}: $v=\sqrt{2 g z}$, with $g$ the gravitational acceleration constant. \cite{d2021torricelli,teoman2022discharge}

A mass balance on a draining tank with Torricelli's law gives a first-order, [generally] nonlinear differential equation governing the liquid level in the tank over time \cite{groetsch1993inverse_tl,seborg2016process,debook}.
The geometry of the tank affects the dynamics of the liquid level through its \emph{horizontal cross-sectional area profile}---i.e., the area of its horizontal cross-section as a function of height.
Regarding the geometry of the orifice, its cross-sectional area gives the volumetric flow rate out of the tank and thus affects the emptying time.
% TODO: a name for cross-sectional area parallel to the ground?
However, a \emph{discharge coefficient} \cite{de2000pin,blasone2015discharge,wadhwa2021study,liu2008drainage} must be introduced into the model for agreement with experimentally-measured volumetric outflow rates \cite{farmer1992physical,driver1998torricelli,brady2009siphons,rother2024modelling,paldy1963apparatus,ivanov2014testing,williams2021vessel,pavesi2019investigating,planinvsivc2011holes,saleta2005experimental,lopac2015water,powell2012carrying}.
The discharge coefficient \cite{teoman2022discharge,hicks2014determining,blasone2015discharge,lienhard1984velocity,wadhwa2021study}
(i) is defined as the ratio of the observed outlet volumetric flow rate to that predicted by Torricelli's law, the area of the orifice, and the assumption of plug flow for the liquid jet \cite{hicks2014determining};
(ii) accounts for 
   (a) the non-uniformity of the velocity profile and vena contracta of the liquid jet (the cross-sectional area of the liquid jet issuing from the orifice is smaller than that of the orifice, owing to fluid streamlines in the tank, near the orifice, non-perpendicular to the face of the orifice \cite{horsch2020simple}) and 
   (b) frictional losses; and
(iii) depends on the properties of the liquid (e.g., viscosity and density), the precise geometry of the orifice, and, for laminar flow, the Reynolds number \cite{teoman2022discharge}. 

In contrast to the \emph{forward problem} of using this dynamic model to predict the trajectory of the liquid level in a draining tank of a given geometry, Groetsch \cite{groetsch1993inverse_tl,groetsch1999inverse} framed an \emph{inverse problem} \cite{groetsch1993inverse,neto2012introduction,tarantola2005inverse}: reconstruct the shape of the tank from its liquid level over time as it drains. 
While impossible to infer the precise geometry of the tank, one can leverage the dynamic model to determine
(a) the horizontal cross-sectional area profile of the tank from (b) the liquid level as a function of time as it drains. (The rate of decrease of the liquid level provides information about the area of the horizontal cross-section of the tank at that height. The outlet flow rate depends on the \emph{height} of water in the tank, not the girth; so, wider [say, cylindrical] tanks drain more slowly.)
However, this inverse problem of reconstruction is unstable: small errors in the measured liquid level can cause large errors in the estimated area profile of the tank. \cite{groetsch1993inverse_tl}

Herein, we employ Bayesian statistical inversion \cite{calvetti2018inverse,waqar2023tutorial,kaipio2006statistical,dashti2013bayesian} to solve, with quantified uncertainty, an inverse problem of reconstruction (``seeing the unseen'' \cite{uhlmann2014inverse}): infer the horizontal cross-sectional area profile of an exogenous solid (of unknown geometry) contained in a draining tank (of known geometry) from measurements of the liquid level in the draining tank over time. 
(We assume the solid is heavy, so it remains stationary, and incapable of holding water.)
Because the solid displaces liquid in the tank, the rate of decrease of the liquid level provides information about the area of the horizontal cross-section of the solid at the height of the liquid. Specifically, the liquid level drops faster as the girth of the solid increases. 
As the tank drains, the liquid ``scans'' the horizontal cross sections of the solid.
To test our ability to reconstruct the area profile of the solid in the tank, we conduct tank drainage experiments with water and collect water level time series data with a level sensing strip. 
First, we build and calibrate (i.e., determine the posterior distribution of the parameters of) (i) a forward model of the dynamics of the water level in our draining tank and (ii) a probabilistic model of measurement noise from our level sensor.
For this task, we take length-measurements of the tank and orifice geometry and collect water level time series data from a tank drainage experiment without an exogenous solid. 
Second, we conduct a tank drainage experiment with an exogenous solid in the tank (a glass bottle filled with water). We then leverage this water level time series data and our calibrated forward and measurement models to obtain a posterior distribution over the horizontal cross-sectional area profile of the solid.
Comparing with our [more] direct (via a tape measure) measurements of the solid's area profile, the inferred area profile of the solid matches the measured profile reasonably well ($<$10\% mean reconstruction error on the bottle's radius). Our approach may be practically useful to non-destructively determine the horizontal cross-sectional area profile of an unknown solid, or the porosity, shape, and/or height of packed solid particles, inside of an opaque or underground tank.

%
%Because this reconstruction problem is unstable \cite{groetsch1993inverse}, 
%We employ Bayesian statistical inversion \cite{calvetti2018inverse,waqar2023tutorial,kaipio2006statistical,dashti2013bayesian} to predict the object's area as a function of height \emph{with quantified uncertainty}.

%To demonstrate and test our ability to solve this reconstruction problem, we conduct tank drainage experiments to collect liquid level time series data.
%We drilled a small hole in the side of an open-top tank, near the bottom.
%For each experiment, we fill the tank (perhaps, containing an exogenous heavy, solid object) with water, then allow it to drain (driven by gravity). A liquid level sensor, communicating with an Arduino microcontroller, measures the liquid level over time, giving liquid level time series data. 


%In this Bayesian approach, we treat each parameter/input in the problem as a random variable and model its probability distribution.
%The prior distribution expresses our beliefs and information about the parameters/inputs \emph{before} liquid level time series data are collected.
%After a tank drainage experiment, we use (a) the [forward] dynamic model of the liquid level, (b) a probabilistic model of the noise in the measured liquid level, and (c) liquid level time series data to construct the likelihood function, which expresses the support the data lend for each possible parameter/input.
%Via Bayes's theorem, the posterior distribution of the parameters/inputs---conditioned upon the liquid level time series data---follows from the prior and likelihood. The posterior, the solution to the reconstruction problem, expresses a probability distribution over the object's cross-sectional area as a function of height, in light of the the liquid level time series data from a drainage experiment.

% The structure of our paper is as follows. Sec.~\ref{sec:expt} describes our setup for tank drainage experiments.
\section{Setup for tank drainage experiments} \label{sec:expt}
First, we describe our experimental setup in Fig.~\ref{fig:photo_of_tank} for tank drainage (of water) experiments.

We possess a plastic tank---an inverted, right, truncated cone with a rounded rectangle base (excluding the top rim). The top of the tank is open to the atmosphere.
We drilled a small, circular orifice of radius $r_o$ [cm] in the side of the tank, parallel with the ground and a small height $h_o$ [cm] (to its center) from the bottom base.



A tank draining experiment constitutes: 
(1) optionally, placing an exogenous, heavy solid inside the tank; 
(2) nearly filling the tank with water, to an initial height $h_0$ [cm]; 
(3) at time $t=0$ [s], allowing the water to drain out (driven by gravity) through the orifice and exit to the atmosphere; and 
(4) collecting time series data of the water level in the tank over time, $\{(t_i, h_{\text{obs}, i}) \}$, from a liquid level sensor communicating with an Arduino microcontroller. 

The exogenous [rigid] solid (i) is heavier than water, and thus remains stationary at the bottom of the tank; (ii) displaces water in the tank; and (iii) has a geometry rendering it incapable of holding water itself (the solid cannot hold water iff it is locally convex at points on its (assume, smooth) surface where the normal vector to the surface is anti-parallel with the gravitational field). Denote the area profile of the solid, $\alpha(h)$ [cm$^2$], as the area of a horizontal cross-section of the exogenous solid at height $h$ [cm] from its bottom base.

\subsection{Geometry of the tank}
%The dynamics of the liquid level in the draining tank depend on both the geometry of the tank and the geometry of the exogenous solid contained in the tank, which displaces water. 
%According to our simplified mathematical model of the draining tank in Sec.~\ref{sec:forward_model}, the liquid level dynamics are dictated solely by the cross-sectional area available to the water inside the tank, as a function of height. 
%For this reason, we distill the geometry of the tank and exogenous solid down into two functions: 
%$a(h)$ and $\alpha(h)$ [cm$^2$], the cross-sectional area of the tank and exogenous solid, respectively, as a function of height $h$, illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:a_and_alpha_of_h_illustration}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:tank_geometry} contains a multi-view drawing of the tank geometry, with its dimensions marked.
The height of the tank is $h_{\text{max}}$ [cm].
Each horizontal cross-section of the tank is a rounded rectangle with length $l$ [cm], width $w$ [cm], and corner-circle radius $r$ [cm].
By definition, a rounded rectangle is the convex hull of four circles, each of radius $r$, whose centers lie at the vertices of a rectangle with length $l$ and width $w$. \cite{rounded_rect}
The length, width, and corner-circle radius of the rounded rectangle constituting the horizontal cross-section of the tank at height $h$ are:
\begin{align}
	l(h) &= \frac{h}{h_{\text{max}}}l_t + \left(1-\frac{h}{h_{\text{max}}}\right) l_b \\
	w(h) &= \frac{h}{h_{\text{max}}}w_t + \left(1-\frac{h}{h_{\text{max}}}\right) w_b \\
	r(h) &= \frac{h}{h_{\text{max}}}r_t + \left(1-\frac{h}{h_{\text{max}}}\right) r_b.
\end{align}
where $l_b$, $w_b$, and $r_b$ [cm] and $l_t$, $w_t$, and $r_t$ [cm] are the length, width, and corner-circle radius of the rounded rectangles forming the bottom and top, respectively, bases of the tank.
In summary, the tank geometry is characterized by the parameters: $l_b$, $w_b$, $r_b$, $l_t$, $w_t$, and $r_t$, and $h_{\rm max}$.

The horizontal cross-sectional area profile of the tank $a(h)$ will dictate its draining dynamics:
\begin{equation}
	a(h) = l(h) w(h) + 2 r(h) [l(h) + w(h)] + \pi [r(h)]^2, \label{eq:a_of_h}
\end{equation}
with $a(h)$ the area of a horizontal cross section of the tank at height $h$ [cm] from its bottom base (see Fig.~\ref{fig:rounded_rectangle} for a visual proof).
%
%where $l_b$, $w_b$, and $r_b$ [cm] and $l_t$, $w_t$, and $r_t$ [cm] are the length, width, and corner-circle radius of the rounded rectangles forming the bottom and top, respectively, bases of the tank.
%In summary, we characterize $\alpha(h)$ by the parameters: $l_b$, $w_b$, $r_b$, $l_t$, $w_t$, and $r_t$, and $h_{\rm max}$.


\subsection{The liquid level sensor}
We place an eTape\texttrademark\xspace liquid level strip vertically inside the tank, immersed in the water. 
The electrically-resistive output of the level strip decreases $\sim$monotonically with the water level as a result of the water compressing the strip via hydrostatic pressure \cite{eTape}.
The sensor communicates with an Arduino microcontroller, providing measurements of the water level over a sequence of times. 
To map the reading from the level sensor [0-1023 integer values] to the liquid level in the tank [cm], we constructed a calibration curve constituting a smooth 1D spline fit to the observed sensor reading at increments of 1 cm water height.



\section{The forward and measurement models and likelihood}
The [deterministic] \emph{forward model} predicts the water level $h(t)$ [m] in our draining tank over time $t$ [s], given the \emph{inputs} $\alpha(h)$ and $h_0$ and \emph{parameters}  $l_b$, $w_b$, $r_b$, $l_t$, $w_t$, and $r_t$, $r_o$, $h_o$, and the discharge coefficient $c$. 
The probabilistic \emph{measurement model} characterizes the noise contaminating a water level measurement $h_{\text{obs}}$ made by our sensor.
After we collect time series data \thedata from a tank drainage experiment, we use the forward and measurement models to construct the \emph{likelihood function}---the probability density of the data \thedata conditioned upon proposed functions/values for the inputs/parameters. 
When any of the inputs/parameters are uncertain in an inverse problem concerning the draining tank, the likelihood function quantifies the support that the data \thedata lend for each possible set of inputs/parameters.

\subsection{Forward model} \label{sec:forward_model}
Here, we develop a mathematical model the height of water in our draining tank as a function of time, $h(t)$ for $t\geq 0$.
(We assume the water at the top of the tank remains flat---allowed by a slow outflow rate). 
To derive this model, we apply conservation of mass to the draining tank and invoke Torricelli's law.
Treating the water as incompressible (i.e., constant density), a mass balance implies a volume balance.
So, the rate of decrease of the volume of water in the tank [cm$^3$/s] equals the volumetric outflow rate at each time. 
% We apply simple geometry and Torricelli's law, respectively, to write both terms, then equate them to arrive at our dynamic model for $h(t)$.
%We treat the water as incompressible (constant density: $\rho$ [g/cm$^3$]) and inviscid. 
%Our model follows from (i) the law of conservation of mass and (ii) Torricelli's law.
% outflow driven by gravity exerting a force on the water above the orifice, causing a hydrostatic pressure in the water at the entrance of the orifice. 

\paragraph{Torricelli's law.}
We model the velocity $v$ [cm/s] of the jet of water flowing out of the orifice at time $t$, when the water height is $h(t)$, with Torricelli's law \cite{d2021torricelli}:
\begin{equation}
	v\left(h(t) \right) =  \sqrt{2 g(h(t)-h_o)}, \label{eq:Torricelli}
\end{equation} where $g$ [cm/s$^2$] is the gravitational acceleration constant. 
Torricelli's law follows from applying Bernoulli's equation \cite{welty2020fundamentals}, a mechanical energy balance, to a streamline of the flow of water from (1) a point at the top of the body of water inside the tank to (2) a point in the outlet stream just outside of the orifice. 
This approximates the water as incompressible and inviscid and the flow along the streamline as at steady-state. See Sec.~\ref{sec:Torricelli} for details.
Considering a small parcel of water, of mass $\Delta m$, that travels along this streamline from the surface of the liquid in the tank to just outside of the orifice,
Torricelli's law matches its gain in kinetic energy $(\Delta m) v^2/2$ with its loss in gravitational potential energy $(\Delta m)g(h-h_o)$.
\cite{groetsch1993inverse_tl,driver1998torricelli,williams2021vessel,epple2017verification}

%If Torricelli's law held and the cross-sectional area of the liquid jet out of the tank were the same as the cross-sectional area of the orifice ($\pi r_o^2$), the volumetric flow rate out of the tank would be $v\pi r_o^2$.
\paragraph{Volumetric outflow rate.}
Invoking Torricelli's law, we model the volumetric flow rate out of the tank at time $t$, when the water height is $h(t)$, as the product of the velocity $v(h(t))$ of the outlet stream, the area of the orifice $\pi r_o^2$, and a [dimensionless] discharge coefficient $c\in(0, 1)$:
\begin{equation}
	c \pi r_o^2 \sqrt{2 g(h(t)-h_o)}. \label{eq:outletflow}
\end{equation}
The discharge coefficient is intended to account for the non-plug flow through the orifice, the vena contracta in the water jet, and frictional losses
\cite{horsch2020simple,teoman2022discharge,hicks2014determining,blasone2015discharge,lienhard1984velocity,wadhwa2021study}. 
% Note, $c=1$ corresponds with an ``ideal'' water jet with cross-sectional area equal to that of the orifice ($\pi r_o^2$), plug flow, and zero frictional losses.

\paragraph{Volume of water in the tank.}
The volume $V$ [cm$^3$] of water in the tank at time $t$, when the water height is $h(t)$, follows from the method of cross-sections in calculus \cite{debook}:
\begin{equation}
	V(h(t))=\int_0^{h(t)} \left[a(y) - \alpha(y) \right] dy. \label{eq:volume}
\end{equation}
The integrand is the horizontal cross-sectional area of water in the tank at height $y$, which is the area of the horizontal cross-section of the tank $a(y)$ minus that of the exogenous solid $\alpha(y)$ displacing water. (We neglect the small volume of water displaced by the level sensor.) 
This expression assumes the solid did not retain water above $h(t)$ as the tank drained. 

%The dynamics of the liquid level in the draining tank depend on both the geometry of the tank and the geometry of the exogenous solid contained in the tank, which displaces water. 

%For this reason, we distill the geometry of the tank and exogenous solid down into two functions: 
%$a(h)$ and $\alpha(h)$ [cm$^2$], the cross-sectional area of the tank and exogenous solid, respectively, as a function of height $h$, illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:a_and_alpha_of_h_illustration}.

\paragraph{Conservation of volume.}
Conservation of volume implies the rate of accumulation of water [cm$^3$/s] in the tank is equal to the negative volumetric outflow rate:
\begin{equation}
	\overbrace{\diff{}{t} \Bigl( V(h(t)) \Bigr )}^{\text{rate of accumulation}}= - \overbrace{ c \pi r_o^2 \sqrt{2 g(h(t)-h_o)}}^{\text{rate of outflow}}. \label{eq:massbalance}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{The forward model.}
Differentiating $V(h(t))$ in eqn.~\ref{eq:volume} and using the chain rule \cite{debook} to rewrite the accumulation term gives our forward model for $h(t)$:
%\begin{empheq}[box=\mybox]{align}
\begin{empheq}[box={\Garybox[forward model]}]{align}
& \left[ a(h)-\alpha(h)\right] \diff{h}{t}= -c \pi r_o^2 \sqrt{2g (h(t)-h_o)}, \,\,\, t \geq 0 \label{eq:forward_model} \\
& h(0)=h_0, \nonumber
\end{empheq}
a [generally] nonlinear, first-order, ordinary differential equation (ODE) in $h(t)$ subject to an initial condition.

\subparagraph{Numerical method to solve the forward model.}
Given the area profiles of the tank and solid $a(h)$ and $\alpha(h)$, the discharge coefficient $c$, the orifice radius and height $r_o$ and $h_o$, and initial water height $h_0$, we numerically solve the ODE in eqn.~\ref{eq:forward_model} (with \texttt{DifferentialEquations.jl} \cite{rackauckas2017differentialequations}, which uses a Runge-Kutta method \cite{tsitouras2011runge}) to predict the water height in our draining tank over time, $h(t)$. 
% I.e., this \emph{forward} model makes predictions of the system output $h(t)$ (an \emph{effect}) when given the parameters and initial condition (the \emph{cause} of the effect).

\subparagraph{A regime of model invalidity.} If the radius of the orifice $r_o$ is small, surface tension of the water may stop flow out of the orifice when $h- h_o$ is positive (but small). In this regime, Torricelli's law and thus our forward model do not hold.


\subparagraph{Parameterizing the solid's area profile.} \label{sec:alpha}
We parameterize the horizontal cross-sectional area profile of the solid in the tank $\alpha(h)$, with a list of $n+1$ evaluations of $\alpha(h)$ on a uniform grid of points on its domain $[0, h_{\text{max}}]$:
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol \alpha := [\alpha_0, \alpha_1, ... \alpha_n] \label{eq:alpha}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_i :=\alpha(i \Delta h)$ for $i \in \{0, ..., n\}$, $\Delta h = h_{\text{max}}/n$, and $0 \leq \alpha_i \leq a(i\Delta h)$ for the solid to fit in the tank.
Then, we construct the function $\alpha(h)$ for $h\in [0, h_{\text{max}}]$ via piecewise, monotonic, cubic interpolation \cite{fritsch1984method} of the function values in $\boldsymbol \alpha$. (\emph{Monotonic} interpolation prevents the unphysical outcome of $\alpha(h) > a(h)$ for any $h \in [0, h_{\text{max}}]$.) 
%From another perspective, we express the solid's area as a function of height as:
%\begin{equation}
%	\alpha(h; \boldsymbol \alpha) = \sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i \phi(h-i \Delta h) \label{eq:alpha_basis}
%\end{equation} where $\phi(x)= \max(0, 1-\lvert x \rvert / (\Delta h)) $ is a triangle ``tent'' basis function \cite{hat_functions}.


\subparagraph{Inputs, output, and model parameters.} 
In the language of inverse problems \cite{groetsch1999inverse,waqar2023tutorial}, we 
consider the solid's area profile $\boldsymbol \alpha$ and initial water level $h_0$ as \emph{inputs} (causal factors) to the system and the water level as a function of time $h(t)$ as the \emph{output} (effect) of the system.
The \emph{model parameters} $\boldsymbol \theta \in \mathbb{R}^{10}$ characterize the geometry of the tank and orifice and, loosely, the viscosity and density of water (embedded in $c$):
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol \theta := [h_{\text{max}}, l_t, w_t, r_t, l_b, w_b, r_b, r_o, h_o, c]. \label{eq:theta}
\end{equation}
(We omit $g$ from $\boldsymbol \theta$ because we treat it as a constant known with certainty.)
Hereafter, we write the forward model as \themodel to indicate the dependence of the output $h(t)$ on the inputs and parameters.

\subsection{Measurement model}
Suppose at time $t$ our water level sensor measures the height of water in the tank, providing a data point $(t, h_{\text{obs}})$ (obs for ``observation''). 
To model [unobservable] noise corrupting the measurement, we treat the measured water level $h_{\text{obs}}$ as a realization of a random variable
\begin{equation}
	H_{\text{obs}} = \themodelnomath + \Psi,
\end{equation}
with the Gaussian-distributed random variable $\Psi \overset{\text{iid}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ the noise, additive to the model output and, among multiple measurements, independent and identically-distributed (iid). 
Then, the probability density of the measured liquid level is a Gaussian centered at the model prediction:
\begin{equation}
	H_{\text{obs}} \mid h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol  \theta, \sigma^2 \overset{\text{iid}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(\themodelnomath, \sigma^2). \label{eq:H_obs_distn}
\end{equation} We are explicit here that this distribution of $H_{\text{obs}}$ is conditioned upon the inputs, parameters, and noise variance. 
(Eqn.~\ref{eq:H_obs_distn} neglects model discrepancy \cite{brynjarsdottir2014learning}.)
% Sources of this noise are: imprecision of the liquid level strip, our calibration curve for the liquid level strip, vibrations

% TODO: plot residuals
% TODO expand 

\subsection{Likelihood function}
The likelihood is the $N$-dimensional probability density of observing $\mathbf{h}_\text{obs}:=(h_{\text{obs},1}, ..., h_{\text{obs},N})$ in time series data \thedata (with each measurement time $t_i$ set) given the inputs $h_0$ and $\boldsymbol \alpha$, model parameters $\boldsymbol \theta$, and noise variance $\sigma^2$. 
Based on eqn.~\ref{eq:H_obs_distn}, the likelihood density is:
\begin{multline}
 \pi_{\text{like}}(\thedatanomath \mid h_0,\boldsymbol  \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 ) = \\ \prod_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{h_{\text{obs}, i} - h(t_i; h_0, \boldsymbol\alpha, \boldsymbol\theta)}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right]. \label{eq:like}
\end{multline}
Once we obtain the data \thedata, we view the likelihood as a function of $h_0$, $\boldsymbol \alpha$, $\boldsymbol \theta$, and $\sigma^2$.
The likelihood function scores the consistency between (a) the model predictions, under proposed values for the inputs and parameters, of the water level over time and (b) our observed water level time series data. Hence, the likelihood function quantifies the support the data lend for each possible set of values for the inputs and parameters \cite{van2021bayesian}. 
% The key idea is: if the data were likely (unlikely) to be obtained under proposed values for the inputs and parameters, then the 

\section{Bayesian statistical inversion (BSI)} \label{sec:bsi}
Here, we outline Bayesian statistical inversion (BSI)  \cite{calvetti2018inverse,waqar2023tutorial,kaipio2006statistical,dashti2013bayesian,allmaras2013estimating}, a tool for solving inverse problems while incorporating prior information and quantifying uncertainty. 
Later, we employ BSI to, using water level time series data from tank drainage experiments,  
(1, parameter inference) calibrate our forward and measurement models and 
(2, reconstruction) infer the area profile of a solid in the tank.

Under BSI, we treat the uncertain input(s) and/or parameters of a tank drainage experiment as random variables and model their probability distributions.
The probability density over input/parameter space expresses our knowledge and beliefs about the inputs/parameters, namely 
(i) they most likely lie in the region containing the bulk of the density and (ii) the spread (concentration) of the density quantifies our uncertainty (certainty) about them. 

%A may summarize the state of our knowledge and beliefs about an input/parameter through the moments of its probability distribution (e.g., mean and variance) with the other inputs/parameters marginalized out. 

The BSI approach to inverse problems with draining tanks follows three stages:


\paragraph{Specify the prior.}
Before we allow the tank to drain and observe water level time series data, we express our knowledge and [to an extent, subjective] beliefs about the inputs and parameters through a \emph{prior} probability density $\pi_{\text{pr}}(h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2)$.
The [marginal] prior density on an input/parameter can range from 
(i) diffuse (e.g.\ a uniform distribution) if we lack knowledge about it, adopting the principle of indifference, to 
(ii) informative (e.g.\ a Gaussian with a small variance) if we possess a [noisy] measurement of it. 
\cite{van2021bayesian}


\paragraph{Gather data and construct the likelihood.}
Next, we conduct a tank drainage experiment (perhaps, with the tank containing an exogenous solid) to collect water level time series data, \thedata. 
When considered against the forward and measurement models, these data provide new information about the inputs and parameters. The likelihood function $\pi_{\text{like}}(\thedatanomath \mid h_0,\boldsymbol  \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 )$ quantifies the support the data lend for different inputs and parameters.


\paragraph{Update the prior to a posterior.}
In light of the data \thedata, we invoke Bayes's theorem  \cite{van2021bayesian,calvetti2018inverse} to update our prior density of the inputs and parameters to a \emph{posterior} density
\begin{multline}
	\pi_{\text{post}}(h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 \mid \thedatanomath) \propto \\ % \frac{
	\phantom{xxx} \pi_{\text{like}}(\thedatanomath \mid h_0,  \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 ) 
	\pi_{\text{pr}}(h_0, \boldsymbol\alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2).
	%}{
	%\pi_{\text{ev}}(\thedatanomath) 
	%},
	 \label{eq:post}
\end{multline} 
A compromise between the likelihood and prior,
the posterior density expresses our knowledge and beliefs about the inputs and parameters \emph{conditioned upon the data} [and, implicitly, the structure of our forward and measurement models]. 
Thus, the posterior represents the raw, uncertainty-quantifying solution to the inverse problem.
Note, uncertainty (entropy) remains in the posterior because
 (i) our measurements are noisy and 
 (ii) perhaps, even noiseless data cannot fully constrain a subset of the parameters/inputs.
(The normalizing factor for the posterior, the \emph{evidence}, is a high-dimensional integral that can, in principle, be computed from the likelihood and prior.)


%The posterior may be 
%(i) summarized with a \emph{credible region} [that contains the bulk of the posterior density] for each parameter/input;
%(ii) queried e.g., ``what is the probability this input/parameter exceeds a certain value?''; and
%(iii) exploited in conjunction with the forward model to make probabilistic predictions, such as predicting the distribution of emptying times for a draining tank.
\subparagraph{Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling from the posterior.}
To approximate the posterior, we conduct Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations \cite{robert1999monte,van2021bayesian} to draw samples of inputs/parameters $(h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 )$ from the posterior density $\pi_{\text{post}}(h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 \mid \thedatanomath)$. 
Using these samples, we can visualize the [marginal] (empirical) posterior distributions, compute credible intervals, and plot posterior samples of liquid level trajectories by solving the forward model with sampled input/parameter values.

MCMC samplers construct and simulate a Markov chain \cite{dobrow2016introduction} on the input/parameter space, designed to have the posterior as its stationary distribution.
A key advantage of MCMC is that it avoids the computationally challenging task of directly computing the evidence---a high-dimensional integral of the prior multiplied by the likelihood function. \cite{van2021bayesian}

We specifically employ the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) \cite{hoffman2014no}, implemented in the probabilistic programming language \cite{gordon2014probabilistic} \texttt{Turing.jl} \cite{ge2018turing,xu2020advancedhmc}, to sample from the posterior.
NUTS is an adaptive variant of the Hamiltonian MC \cite{betancourt2017conceptual} sampler, which (i) at each iteration, proposes a state transition then accepts or rejects it under a probabilistic criterion and (ii) leverages local geometric information about the log-posterior (its gradient, computed via automatic differentiation \cite{baydin2018automatic}) to guide state transition proposals, inspired by the dynamics of physical systems \cite{duane1987hybrid}.
Each iteration involves multiple evaluations of the forward model under different sets of inputs/parameters to compute the log-posterior and its gradient \cite{paun2022emulation,patel2024multi}. 
Compared to simpler MCMC samplers (e.g., random walk Metropolis and Gibbs), NUTS can ``converge'' \cite{roy2020convergence} with many fewer iterations
(though, each iteration is more computationally expensive)
\cite{chong2017comparison,hoffman2014no,robert2018accelerating,shi2024bayesian,turner2017well}.

% to the stationary distribution with fewer iterations and provide a larger effective sample size under a given number of iterations, 


\section{Results}
We now employ BSI to, using water level time series data from tank drainage experiments,  
(1, parameter inference) calibrate our forward and measurement models then
(2, reconstruction) exploit our calibrated model to infer the horizontal cross-sectional area profile of a solid contained in the tank.

\subsection{Phase I: Bayesian calibration of the forward and measurement models}
\label{sec:phaseI}
Our objective now is to calibrate then test our forward and measurement models.
At this point, the model parameters $\boldsymbol \Theta$ and measurement noise variance $\Sigma^2$ are highly uncertain and, thus, treated as random variables (notation: upper-case $\boldsymbol \Theta$ denotes the random variable, the lower-case version $\boldsymbol \theta$ denotes a realization).
To gather information about $\boldsymbol \Theta$ and $\Sigma^2$, we (a) take length-measurements of the tank and orifice geometry and (b) collect water level time series data from a tank drainage experiment without an exogenous solid (i.e., certainly, $\boldsymbol \alpha = \mathbf{0}$).
The \emph{calibrated model} constitutes eqns.~\ref{eq:forward_model} and \ref{eq:H_obs_distn} with the resulting posterior distribution of $\boldsymbol \Theta$ and $\Sigma^2$. We test the calibrated model for its capability to predict the liquid level trajectory in a replicate tank drainage experiment.

% The key idea is that our length-measurements of the tank and orifice geometry and water level time series data from a drainage experiment in a tank without an object provide information about the parameters and measurement noise variance. 
%Hopefully, the calibrated model will allow us to accuracy solve the reconstruction problem in Phase II. 
% Here, we also conduct a replicate experiment for testing the calibrated model. 
% Since we directly measured the other parameters in $\theta$, the two primary unknowns for our model calibration phase are the discharge coefficient $C$ and noise variance $\Sigma^2$. 

\subsubsection{Experimental setup}
We set up a tank draining experiment with an initial water level (measured by the level strip) $h_{0, \text{obs}}=26.54$\,cm. 
With certainty, the tank does not contain an exogenous solid. See Fig.~\ref{fig:naked_tank}.

\subsubsection{Prior distributions} 
We express our knowledge and beliefs about the inputs and parameters, before allowing the tank to drain and observing water level time series data, by constructing a prior density $\pi_{\text{pr}}(h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2)$ variable-by-variable (assuming independence). Together with the forward model in eqn.~\ref{eq:forward_model}, $\pi_{\text{pr}}(h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2)$ gives a prior distribution over water level trajectories in the tank, \themodel. 
Fig~\ref{fig:prior_train} shows samples of functions \themodel from the prior, which encodes a broad range of possible trajectories of the liquid level. 

\subparagraph{Tank geometry.} We use a measuring tape to make length-measurements of the dimensions of the tank.
Specifically, we measure the length, width, and perimeter of the rounded rectangle forming the top and bottom of the tank, giving estimates 
$l_{t, \text{obs}}=11.2$\,cm, $w_{t, \text{obs}}=5.6$\,cm, $r_{t, \text{obs}}=1.7$\,cm,
$l_{b, \text{obs}}=10.7$\,cm, $w_{b, \text{obs}}=5.1$\,cm, and $r_{b, \text{obs}}=1.3$\,cm, and the height of the tank $h_{\text{max}, \text{obs}}=28.6$\,cm.
(The corresponding estimates for the area of the top- and bottom-base of the tank are $a_{t, \text{obs}}=129.0$\,cm and $a_{b, \text{obs}}=103.0$\,cm.)
Informed by these [noisy and imprecise] measurements, we impose Gaussian prior distributions:
\begin{align}
L_{t,b} &\sim \mathcal{N}(l_{t,b, \text{obs}}, \sigma_\ell^2) \\
W_{t,b} &\sim \mathcal{N}(w_{t,b, \text{obs}}, \sigma_\ell^2) \\
R_{t,b} &\sim \mathcal{N}(r_{t,b, \text{obs}}, \sigma_\ell^2) \\
H_{\text{max}} &\sim \mathcal{N}(h_{\text{max}, \text{obs}}, \sigma_\ell^2)
\end{align}
where $\sigma_\ell=0.1$\,cm is the [assumed] standard deviation of our length-measurements, based on the markings on our measurement tape. 


\subparagraph{Orifice height and geometry.} 
We measure the height of the orifice in the side of the tank as $h_{o, \text{obs}}=0.9$\,cm and impose an informative prior:
\begin{equation}
H_o \sim \mathcal{N}(h_{o, \text{obs}}, \sigma_\ell^2).
\end{equation}
Informed by the manufacturer-reported diameter (5/64\,in) of the drill bit we used to drill the [circular] hole in the tank, we estimate the radius of the orifice as $r_{o, \text{obs}}=0.1$\,cm and impose the prior:
\begin{equation}
R_o \sim \mathcal{N}(r_{o, \text{obs}}, \sigma_d^2), \label{eq:R_o_prior}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_d= 0.001$\,cm expresses uncertainty in the bit radius and its translation into an orifice.


\subparagraph{Exogenous solid geometry.}
With certainty, no solid resides in the tank, so $\boldsymbol \alpha=\mathbf{0}$. Technically, this is a Dirac delta prior density on $\mathbf{A}$, $\pi_{\text{pr}}(\boldsymbol \alpha)=\delta(\boldsymbol \alpha - \mathbf{0})$. 


% TODO mention truncations



\subparagraph{Discharge coefficient.} 
Our prior distribution on the discharge coefficient is weakly informed:
\begin{equation}
	C \sim \mathcal{N}(0.65, \sigma_c^2)
\end{equation} with $\sigma_c=0.25$ expressing our uncertainty about it. The mean is a reported discharge coefficient for water flow through a round orifice \cite{hicks2014determining}. 


\subparagraph{Variance of measurement noise.} 
We impose a uniform prior on the standard deviation of the noise emanating from our water level sensor:
\begin{equation}
\Sigma \sim \mathcal{U}(0\,\text{cm}, 0.5\,\text{cm}),
\end{equation} whose generous upper bound is informed by our experience in calibrating the liquid level strip. 


\subparagraph{Initial water level.} We impose an informative prior distribution on the initial water level based on the initial reading of the water level sensor:
\begin{equation}
	H_0 \mid \sigma \sim \mathcal{N}(h_{0, \text{obs}}, \sigma^2).
\end{equation} 


\subsubsection{Water level time series data from a tank-drainage experiment} At time $t:=0$, we allow the tank to drain of water while our level sensor records the water level over time. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_train} shows the resulting water level time series data \thedata.

\subsubsection{Posterior distribution}
The posterior distribution $\pi_{\text{post}}(h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 \mid \thedatanomath)$ follows from our prior and likelihood function constructed from the data \thedata (see eqn.~\ref{eq:post}). (We omit the last three data points in the time series because surface tension of the water, neglected by our model, stopped the outflow here, before $h$ reached $h_o$.)
We employ NUTS with a target acceptance ratio of $0.65$ to draw $2500$/chain samples of inputs/parameters from the posterior over three independent chains, excluding the first half of each chain which is discarded for ``burn-in''.

%TODO how many samples

Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_train_theta} visualizes the empirical posterior distribution. 
The left panel shows the [marginal] empirical posterior distributions (histograms) of the parameters and initial water level along with their 80\% equal-tailed credible intervals. 
For the variables we estimated with our measuring tape, the credible intervals are centered at our estimates. 
The measured initial water level, however, falls outside of the credible interval; a higher initial water level than measured is more consistent with the time series data.
The right panel shows the matrix of correlations between the parameters and input. E.g. $c$ exhibits a negative correlation with $r_o$ because a given outflow rate is consistent with both large $r_o$ and small $c$ and small $r_0$ and large $c$ (see the $cr_0^2$ term in eqn.~\ref{eq:forward_model}).

%The information that the data from this tank-draining experiment provided about $C$ and $\Sigma$ will be useful for the reconstruction inverse problem of inferring the shape of an object inside the tank from water level time series data. (We assume the object does not affect the discharge coefficient nor noise in the liquid level sensor.)


As a posterior predictive check, Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_train} shows water level trajectories \themodel, with $(\thevars)$ sampled from the posterior distribution. The trajectories agree reasonably with the measured water level over time (mean absolute residual: 0.26\,cm). 
Comparing the prior and posterior distributions of water level trajectories in Fig.~\ref{fig:prior_train} and Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_train}, the much-reduced range among the posterior trajectories reflects the information about the parameter vector that we gained from considering the water level time series data against the forward and measurement models.



The forward and measurement models in eqn.~\ref{eq:forward_model} and \ref{eq:H_obs_distn} together with the posterior distribution $\pi_{\text{post}}(\boldsymbol \theta, \boldsymbol \sigma^2 \mid \thedatanomath)$ (with $h_0$ marginalized out and $\boldsymbol \alpha=\mathbf{0}$) constitute the \emph{calibrated model}.
%The calibrated model will be useful for solving the reconstruction problem in phase II, because the presence of an object inside the tank presumably does not affect the parameter vector $\boldsymbol \theta$ nor the measurement noise variance $\sigma^2$ of the level sensor.
We approximate the posterior as a multi-variate Gaussian
\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol \Theta \\ \Sigma \end{bmatrix} \mid \thedatanomath \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{m}, \mathbf{C}) \label{eq:post_theta_sigma}
\end{equation}
with mean $\mathbf{m}$ and covariance matrix $\mathbf{C}$ computed from our MCMC samples from the posterior. 
(See Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_train_theta} for the means of each parameter in $\mathbf{m}$ and the correlation matrix, which is a normalized version of $\mathbf{C}$.)

\subsubsection{Testing the calibrated model with a replicate experiment}
Finally, we test our calibrated model for its capability to predict the dynamics of the water level in our draining tank in a new, replicate experiment (also, without an exogenous solid, so $\boldsymbol \alpha=\mathbf{0}$) with measured initial water level $h_{0, \text{obs}}=26.49$\,cm. 
We sample water level trajectories \themodel predicted by the calibrated model by (1) sampling a $\boldsymbol \theta$ and $\sigma$ from the posterior distribution in eqn.~\ref{eq:post_theta_sigma}, (2) sampling an initial water level from $H_0 \mid \sigma \sim \mathcal{N}(h_{0, \text{obs}}, \sigma^2)$, then (3) numerically solving the forward model to obtain \themodel.
Fig.~\ref{fig:test} shows the held-out water level time series data collected from the replicate experiment, \thedata, agree well with the trajectories \themodel predicted by the calibrated model (mean absolute residual: 0.29\,cm). 
(For kicks, we also show the distribution of predicted tank-emptying times, $T_e := \min_{t \geq 0 :\, h(t)=h_o} t$.)

\subsection{Phase II: Bayesian inference of the area profile of a solid inside the tank} \label{sec:phaseII}
Finally, we exploit our calibrated model to infer the horizontal cross-sectional area profile of an exogenous, stationary, heavy solid (incapable of holding water itself) inside of our tank from water level time series data as it drains.
Our objective is to obtain the posterior distribution of $\mathbf{A}$ (random variable version of $\boldsymbol \alpha$) characterizing the area profile of the solid, $\alpha(h; \mathbf{A})$ (see Sec.~\ref{sec:alpha}).

\subsubsection{Experimental setup}
We set up a tank drainage experiment by:
(i) placing a solid object---a large, capped, glass bottle filled with water [so it sinks]---inside of the tank, which remains stationary as the tank drains;
(ii) filling the tank to an initial water level (measured by the level strip) of $h_{0, \text{obs}}=26.49$\,cm. 
See Fig.~\ref{fig:tank_w_bottle}.


\subsubsection{Prior distributions}
Before allowing the tank to drain, we express our prior knowledge and beliefs about the inputs and parameters below.
Fig.~\ref{fig:prior_area} displays samples of our prior distribution over (left) the solid's area profile (for perspective, the area profile of the tank is also shown) and (right) liquid level trajectories. 
Our prior over the solid's area profile encodes a uniform distribution over the radius of the solid in the tank, but promotes a smoothly-varying radius as a function of height. 
%Our prior distribution for (i) the initial water level $H_0$ is informed by the initial water level measurement; (ii) the parameter vector $\boldsymbol \Theta$ and measurement noise variance $\Sigma^2$ is informed by the model calibration phase; and (iii) the object area $\mathbf{A}$ (a) is diffuse, to entertain a large range of possible object shapes in the tank, and (b) promotes a smooth function $\alpha(h)$. Fig.~\ref{fig:prior_area} displays samples from the prior distribution for the object shape vector $\mathbf{A}$. 
% Below, we express our knowledge and beliefs about the inputs and parameters, before allowing the tank to train and collecting water level time series data, by constructing a prior probability density $\pi_{\text{pr}}(h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2)$. 


\subparagraph{The parameter vector and measurement noise variance.}
Adopting the adage ``yesterday's posterior is today's prior'' \cite{calvetti2010subjective}, 
our multi-variate Gaussian posterior distribution of the parameter vector $\boldsymbol \Theta$ and noise variance $\Sigma^2$ from model calibration (in eqn.~\ref{eq:post_theta_sigma}) now serves as our prior distribution.
Thereby, we exploit our \emph{calibrated} model for this reconstruction problem.
(We assume the solid in the tank does not affect the discharge coefficient.)


\subparagraph{Initial water level.} We again impose an informative prior distribution on the initial water level based on the initial reading of the water level sensor:
\begin{equation}
	H_0 \mid \sigma \sim \mathcal{N}(h_{0, \text{obs}}, \sigma^2).
\end{equation}

\subparagraph{Shape of the exogenous solid.}
We adopt the principle of indifference and impose a diffuse prior over the square root of the area of the horizontal cross-section of the solid in the tank, but impose smoothness as a function of height to counter instability\cite{groetsch1993inverse_tl}. 
By imposing a diffuse prior on the solid's area profile, we allow the water level time series data to ``speak for itself'' about the solid's size.
Specifically, we impose a uniform distribution on the square root of the area of the bottom base of the solid, $A_0$ (the random variable version of $\alpha(0)$):
\begin{equation}
	\sqrt{A_0} \mid a_b \sim \mathcal{U}(0, \sqrt{a_b}).
\end{equation} 
So, we believe the square root of the area of the solid's bottom base is equally probable to be anywhere within zero (corresponding to the lack of an exogenous solid) to the square root of the area of tank's bottom base $a_b$ (corresponding to the largest solid that can fit in the tank).
(For a radially symmetric solid, we are imposing a uniform distribution on its radius.)
For the smoothness prior \cite{calvetti2018inverse}, we sequentially correlate the solid's square-root-area at the sequence of heights: 
\begin{equation}
 \sqrt{A_i} - \sqrt{A_{i-1}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \gamma^2) \text{ for } i \in \{1, ..., n\}.
\end{equation} 
The zero mean Gaussian distribution on the difference in the square-root-area of the solid at two adjacent heights means we expect the function $\sqrt{\alpha(h)}$ to be locally flat and change slowly. 
The variance hyperparameter $\gamma^2$ controls the degree to which we promote smoothness in $\sqrt{\alpha (h)}$ (smaller $\gamma^2$ promotes more smoothness). 
Finally, for physicality, we also truncate each random variable $A_i$ so it falls within zero to the area of the tank at that height.



%  This is a visualization of our beliefs about the shape of the object in the tank before water level time series data from the ``object scan'' are collected and considered against the forward model.

\subsubsection{Water level time series data from a tank-drainage experiment}
Next, at time $t=0$, we allow our tank containing the exogenous solid to drain of water. Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_object} shows the time series data of the water level \thedata obtained from our level sensor. Compared to the water level dynamics in the calibration experiment where the tank was devoid of an exogenous solid (Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_train}), the tank drained more quickly, owing to the displacement of water by the solid in the tank.

\subsubsection{Posterior distribution}
Again, we employ NUTS to obtain samples from the posterior $\pi_{\text{post}}(h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 \mid \thedatanomath)$. 
%Via Bayes's theorem in , the posterior distribution $\pi_{\text{post}}(h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 \mid \thedatanomath)$ follows from (i) prior probability density $\pi_{\text{pr}}(h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2)$---informed for $H_0$, $\boldsymbol \Theta$, and $\Sigma^2$ and diffuse but smooth for $\mathbf{A}$---and (ii) tank drainage data \thedata, from which we construct the likelihood function in eqn.~\ref{eq:like}, the posterior distribution $\pi_{\text{post}}(h_0, \boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 \mid \thedatanomath)$ follows from Bayes's theorem in eqn.~\ref{eq:post}. 
%We employ the MCMC sampler, NUTS, to obtain samples $\{(h_{0,i}, \boldsymbol \alpha_i, \boldsymbol \theta_i, \sigma^2_i\}$ from the posterior distribution. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_area} shows posterior samples of the horizontal cross-sectional area profile of the solid---the BSI solution to the reconstruction problem (seeing the area profile of the unseen solid). 
For comparison, we also show (i) the bottle's [roughly-] ground-truth area at different heights, obtained from our length-measurements of its circumference at different heights, and (ii) for perspective, posterior samples of the tank's area profile. First, the posterior of the solid's shape exhibits much lower variance than the prior in Fig.~\ref{fig:prior_area}. This reflects the information the water level time series data provided about the solid's area profile. 
Second, the posterior of the solid's area profile agrees reasonably well with the measured area of the bottle (mean residual radius: 0.35\,cm; mean bottle radius 3.2\,cm), but a little bias is present in $h\in[15, 20]$\,cm.
Third, note the variance in the posterior over the solid's area for $h<h_o$ and $h>h_0$ is larger than in $h_o < h < h_0$. This reflects the impossibility for the water level data to provide information about the solid's area where the water was unable to ``scan'' it. 
For $h<h_o$ and $h>h_0$, the smoothness prior restricts the range of the predicted area---essentially, extrapolating. 

As a posterior predictive check, Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_object} displays samples of liquid level trajectories \themodel from the posterior distribution, which match the water level time series data \thedata reasonably well (mean absolute residual: 0.35\,cm). 

\subsubsection{Conclusion} Overall, Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_area} illustrates our ability to infer the horizontal cross-sectional area profile of a solid contained in a draining tank with quantified uncertainty---using (i) a calibrated dynamic model of the water level in the tank as it drains through a small orifice and (ii) water level time series data over the process of draining. 
The key idea is that the water ``scans'' the solid's area profile as it drops.


\section{Conclusions and Discussion}
We demonstrated our ability to reconstruct, with quantified uncertainty, the horizontal cross-sectional area profile of a heavy, exogenous solid (incapable of holding water) inside a tank from (i) a calibrated dynamic model of the liquid level in the tank as it drains (driven by gravity) through a small orifice and (ii) measurements of the liquid level in the tank over time as it drains.
First, we constructed, Bayesian-calibrated, and tested a forward model for the dynamics of the water level in our draining tank.
The calibrated model predicted the water level trajectory in our tank in a replicate experiment well.
Then, we exploited our Bayesian-calibrated forward model to reconstruct the area profile of an exogenous, heavy solid (a bottle) inside our draining tank using water level time series data. 
Essentially, the top of the water in the tank ``scanned'' the area of horizontal cross sections of the solid as the tank drained. 
The posterior distribution of the bottle's area profile agreed reasonably well with our [more] direct measurements of its area profile, with $\sim 10$\% reconstruction error over the bottle's radius. 
% In conclusion, a forward model of the dynamics of the liquid level in a draining tank containing an exogenous solid, a probabilistic measurement model of the liquid level sensor, and liquid level time series data during the process of draining together allow us to reconstruct the area of the exogenous solid as a function of height with quantified uncertainty via Bayesian statistical inversion. 

Our reconstruction methodology herein could be employed throughout engineering and applied sciences to non-destructively/non-invasively determine the area profile of an exogenous solid inside of an opaque or inaccessible (e.g., underground \cite{gephart2010short}) liquid-holding tank---with quantified uncertainty.
With some modification, one could also infer the height and/or porosity of a bed of small, heavy solid particles (e.g. gravel, sand) packed into a tank \cite{guellouz2020estimation}; perhaps, we could infer the \emph{shape} of the particles as well, by coupling with a packing model \cite{zhang2006relationship}. 
While our methodology requires access to the liquid level in the tank as it drains, we could infer the liquid level from the volumetric flow rate or the geometry of the liquid jet exiting from the tank \cite{groetsch1999inverse,davidovic2020visualizing}.

\paragraph{Can we infer the precise geometry of a solid in an opaque, draining tank?}
Our ambition to reconstruct the geometry of an exogenous solid inside a draining tank from its liquid level over time was limited to seeking its horizontal cross-sectional area profile.
Determining the precise geometry of the solid from liquid level dynamics is impossible because the dynamics of $h(t)$ depend solely on the horizontal cross-sectional area of the solid as a function of height (see eqn.~\ref{eq:forward_model}); and, there are multiple non-congruent solids with an identical horizontal cross-sectional area profile (e.g., a cylinder and rectangular prism with the same cross-sectional area as a function of height). We speculate that, by conducting multiple tank-draining experiments with the tank tilted and held at different angles, we may be able to reconstruct the precise geometry of the solid in the tank. The key idea is that two non-congruent solids with an identical \emph{horizontal} cross-sectional area profile exhibit different area profiles at differently-angled cross sections.
Possibly, we can probe the area profiles at these different angles by tilting the tank. 
Two complications are: (i) gravity could cause the shape to rotate when the tank is tilted and (ii) for large tanks, underground tanks, or tanks in confined spaces, tilting is not infeasible. 

\paragraph{Remarks.} (1) We could have calibrated our forward and measurement models using data from a tank drainage experiment where the tank \emph{did} contain an exogenous solid, provided the horizontal cross-sectional area profile of the solid were known with some certainty. (2) If we knew the solid's shape belonged to a certain category (e.g.\ a right circular cone), we could have parameterized its area as a function of height with fewer variables (e.g.\ height and base radius). 

\paragraph{Extensions.}
(1) Our forward model of the dynamics of the liquid level in an \emph{open-top} tank, containing a \emph{solid}, draining of liquid through a \emph{small} orifice in its side \emph{without} additional input/output of liquid could be extended to handle inverse problems concerning
(a) closed tanks, where the air pressure in the headspace is not constant and atmospheric during draining \cite{cross2016filling}; 
(b) larger orifices, so the liquid at the top does not remain flat (necessitating computational fluid dynamics simulations \cite{mathew2014numerical,sakri2017numerical});
(c) additional inputs/outputs of liquid by adding source/sink terms; 
(d) Mariotte's bottle \cite{kirevs2006mariotte}; and/or
(e) a flexible exogenous object compressible by hydrostatic pressure, such as a balloon \cite{muller2004rubber}. 
(2) During Bayesian model calibration, a model discrepancy \cite{brynjarsdottir2014learning,kennedy2001bayesian,eugene2023learning} function could capture any bias---i.e., a difference between the true dynamics of the liquid level in the tank and the model $h(t; h_0^*,  \boldsymbol \alpha^*, \boldsymbol \theta^*)$ with the true/best-fit (indicated by $*$) initial water level, solid area profile, and parameters.
% In other words, we assume our forward model is capable of capturing the true liquid level dynamics in the tank without bias.
(3) Finally, another interesting inverse problem pertaining to a draining tank is time reversal: infer the initial water level from measurement(s) of the water level at later times.

\paragraph{Other geometric inverse problems.}
Examples of other geometric inverse problems, where the unknown is a geometric shape \cite{ameur2004level,burger2001level,harbrecht2013numerical,kawakami2020stabilities}, include inferring
(i) from boundary measurements: the shape and location of cracks in a solid \cite{nishimura1991boundary}, fouling on the inner wall of a pipe \cite{chen2011inverse}, mines underground \cite{delbary2007inverse,lopez2003detection}, scattering objects like submarines \cite{yaman2013survey} underwater \cite{buchanan2004marine}, and inclusions or cavities inside thermal conductors \cite{wang2018numerical,nakamura2015reconstruction};
(ii) the shape of obstacles in blood vessels from flow measurements \cite{aguayo2021distributed,nolte2022inverse}; 
(iii) the shape of a membrane from the sound it produces when it vibrates \cite{kac1966can}; 
and 
(iv) the potential energy of a particle interacting with a surface as a function of distance, from the distribution of [fluctuating] distance measurements \cite{prieve1999measurement}.
Geometric inverse problems leading to optimal engineering designs include determining: 
(i) the region in input space, constituting design and operating parameters, for a chemical reactor that gives an output falling in a desired set \cite{alves2023inverse,gazzaneo2019process}; 
(ii) the shape of (a) an adhesive pillar that gives a desired interfacial stress distribution \cite{kim2020designing};
(b) particles giving a desired packing stiffness \cite{miskin2013adapting}, self-assembly behavior \cite{sacanna2013engineering}, or optical properties \cite{forestiere2016inverse};
(c) an airfoil giving desired aerodynamic properties \cite{sun2015artificial};
(d) the blades of a heat exchanger achieve a desired heat exchange \cite{hilbert2006multi};
or
(e) a fixed-bed chemical reactor giving a desired conversion \cite{courtais2021shape}.
