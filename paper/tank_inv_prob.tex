\section{Introduction}
Throughout engineering and the applied sciences, we encounter a liquid-holding tank that is draining via gravity-driven flow through a small orifice.
Mathematical models of the dynamics of the liquid level in a draining tank are useful for designing the geometry of the tank and orifice, predicting the emptying time, forecasting the outlet flow rate, controlling the liquid level via an input stream, and inferring the liquid level from the outlet flow rate \cite{d2021torricelli,seborg2016process,groetsch1993inverse,groetsch1999inverse}.

\begin{mytcbox}[label=box:waterclocks, breakable]{Ancient water clocks}
Interestingly, ancient societies (e.g. ancient Greece) exploited the empirically predictable dynamics of the water level in a draining tank to measure and display the passage of time.
Specifically, the outflow \emph{clepsydra}, Greek for ``water thief'', was an open-top container with a small hole near its bottom and graduated markings on the inside. 
Filled with water then allowed to drain, the elapsed time was indicated by the liquid level with respect to the markings on the inside. \cite{bedini1962compartmented,hwang2021historical,ritner2016oriental,hejun1987research,schomberg2018karnak,mills1982newton}
The preserved Karnak clepsydra from $\sim$1300 BC \cite{schomberg2018karnak} is an inverted truncated cone. Notably, this geometry does not provide a constant rate of decrease in the liquid level; perhaps, though, its wider top was intended to compensate for faster outflow at higher liquid levels. An inverse problem pertaining to an outflow clepsydra is: what container shape gives a constant rate of decrease in the liquid level as it drains?
(Such a clepsydra may be obtained via a solid of revolution about the vertical axis such that the radius is proportional to the quartic root of the height. \cite{mills1982newton,d2021torricelli})
\end{mytcbox}
%Draining tanks have been studied since ancient times, as evidenced by water clocks in ancient Egypt, Greece, India, and China.
%The water clock, or clepsydra (Greek for ''water thief''), of the outflow design consisted of an open-top container, filled with water at some reference time, with a small orifice for outflow near its bottom.

%The geometry of an ideal clepsydra would produce a constant rate of decrease in the liquid level. However, the geometry of e.g. the preserved Karnak clepsydra from $\sim$1300 BC \cite{schomberg2018karnak}, an inverted truncated cone, does not. Though, perhaps, its wider top was intended to compensate for the faster outflow when the liquid level is higher.

% Italian physicist and mathematician 
Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647) made a fundamental observation for mathematical modeling the liquid level in a tank draining via gravity-driven flow through a small orifice: the velocity $v$ at which liquid flows out of the orifice is proportional to the square root of the height of liquid above the orifice, $\Delta h$, i.e. $v\propto \sqrt{\Delta h}$ \cite{mills1982newton}.
% TODO: check that he didn't know g!
Today, we recover Torricelli's observation from Daniel Bernoulli's (1700â€“1782) equation \cite{welty2020fundamentals}, a mechanical energy balance applied to the steady, plug flow of an incompressible, inviscid fluid through the orifice, with frictional forces neglected. This gives \emph{Torricelli's law}: $v=\sqrt{2 g \Delta h}$, with $g$ the acceleration due to gravity. \cite{d2021torricelli,teoman2022discharge}

Applying a mass balance and Torricelli's law to a tank draining of liquid via gravity-driven flow through a small orifice, we obtain a first-order, [generally] nonlinear differential equation governing the liquid level in the tank over time \cite{groetsch1993inverse,seborg2016process,debook}.
The geometry of the tank affects the dynamics of the liquid level through its cross-sectional area (parallel to the ground) as a function of height.
The cross-sectional area of the orifice theoretically gives the volumetric flow rate out of the tank from Torricelli's law. 
% TODO: a name for cross-sectional area parallel to the ground?
However, for the model to agree with the experimentally measured liquid level in a draining tank over time \cite{de2000pin,blasone2015discharge,wadhwa2021study,liu2008drainage}, a discharge coefficient, defined as the ratio of the observed outlet volumetric flow rate to that predicted by Torricelli's law and the area of the orifice \cite{hicks2014determining}, is introduced into the model. 
The discharge coefficient, typically around 0.6,
accounts for frictional losses across the orifice, non-uniformity of the velocity profile, and the vena contracta of the liquid jet.
The latter phenomenon of narrowing, i.e. where the cross-sectional area of the liquid jet issuing from the orifice is smaller than the area of the orifice, is due to fluid streamlines inside of the tank near the edge of the orifice with orientation not perpendicular to the side of the tank \cite{horsch2020simple}. 
%  and (ii) depends on the rheology of the fluid and the geometry of the orifice. 
\cite{teoman2022discharge,hicks2014determining,blasone2015discharge,lienhard1984velocity,wadhwa2021study}

% Note, Torricelli's law combined with kinematic equations on a packet of fluid ejected from the orifice of the tank give the trajectory of the liquid jet, too \cite{groetsch1999inverse}.

A draining tank is an intuitive, relatable physical system to mathematically model in an undergraduate course. 
More, experiments in the classroom to collect data to validate the model of the liquid level over time are accessible and illustrate the effectiveness of mathematical models.
\cite{farmer1992physical,driver1998torricelli,brady2009siphons,rother2024modelling,paldy1963apparatus,ivanov2014testing,williams2021vessel,pavesi2019investigating,planinvsivc2011holes,saleta2005experimental,lopac2015water,powell2012carrying}
Draining tanks provide undergraduate-friendly inverse problems \cite{groetsch1993inverse,neto2012introduction,tarantola2005inverse} as well, such as inferring the shape of the tank from the observed liquid level over time \cite{groetsch1993inverse,groetsch1999inverse}. 

\subsection{Our contribution}
In this article, we consider the following inverse problem pertaining to a tank draining of liquid
practically important:
interesting: infer a function. 


\section{Experimental setup} \label{sec:expt}
In our experimental setup, we (1) fill a small, open-top, plastic tank with water, to an initial level $h_0$ [cm], then (2) at time $t=0$ [s], allow the water to drain out through a small orifice in the side of the tank, near its bottom. 
We use a liquid level strip to measure the water level in the tank over time, giving time series data $\{(t_i, h_{\text{obs}, i}) \}$. The tank may or may not have a heavy, solid, stationary object inside of it, displacing water and thus affecting the dynamics of emptying. Fig.~\ref{fig:photo_of_tank} shows a photo of an experiment where the tank does not have an object inside of it.

Ultimately, we conduct a set of three experiments. The first two [repeat] experiments concern the tank without the object, for the purpose of gathering data to calibrate then test a dynamic mathematical model of the liquid level in the tank. The third experiment concerns the tank with an object inside of it, for the purpose of indirectly gathering data about then inferring the shape of that object.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
	% \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{../tank_geometry/photo_of_tank.png}
	\caption{\textbf{Experimental setup.} 
	The water-holding tank is shaped as inverted, right, truncated cone with a rounded rectangle base and has a small hole in its side. In our experiments, we fill the tank with water, then allow the tank to drain via gravity-driven flow out of the small hole. A liquid level strip measures the liquid level in the tank over time, giving time series data.
	}
	\label{fig:photo_of_tank}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The tank geometry.} The water-holding tank is approximately an inverted, right, truncated cone with a rounded rectangle as its base. The cross-sectional area [parallel to the ground] of the tank as a function of height $h$ [cm] from its bottom base is:
\begin{equation}
	a(h) = \frac{h}{h_{\text{max}}}a_t + \left(1-\frac{h}{h_{\text{max}}}\right) a_b, \label{eq:a_of_h}
\end{equation}
with $h_{\text{max}}$ [cm] the height of the tank and $a_b$ [cm$^2$] and $a_t$ [cm$^2$] the area of the rounded rectangle forming the bottom and top, respectively, base of the tank.
The top of the tank is open to the atmosphere. 

\paragraph{The small orifice in the side of the tank.} The tank has a small, circular hole of radius $r_o$ [cm] in its side, whose center is a small height $h_o$ [cm] from the bottom base.
Thus, when the liquid level in the tank is larger than $h_o$, water flows out of this small orifice.
(When drilling the hole, we held the drill bit parallel to the floor.) 

\paragraph{The object [possibly] inside the tank.} We may place a heavy (denser than water), solid object inside the tank. Because the object is solid, it displaces water while in the tank. Because this object is heavy, it remains at rest, at the bottom of the tank, throughout the experiment. Let $\alpha(h)$ be the cross-sectional [parallel to the floor] area of this object as a function of height $h$.

\paragraph{The liquid level sensor.} We place a liquid level strip vertically inside the tank to measure the water level in the tank over time. The liquid level sensor communicates with an Arduino microcontroller, allowing us to automatically collect the time series data and write it to a file. The liquid level strip functions by virtue of water coming into contact with it and changing the electrical resistance. 
% TODO look at manual
We constructed a calibration curve with a resolution of 1 cm to map the reading of the level sensor [V] to the liquid level in the tank [cm]. 
% what are the units of the reading of liquid level sensor

\section{The forward and measurement models}
The \emph{forward model} provides a prediction of the liquid level $h(t)$ [m] in our draining tank over time $t$ [s], given the following \emph{parameters}: shape of the tank $a(h)$, the shape of the object inside our tank $\alpha(h)$, the radius of the circular orifice $r_o$, the height $h_o$ of the orifice, the discharge coefficient $c$, and the initial liquid level $h_0$. 
Coupled with a probabilistic \emph{measurement model} characterizing the noise contaminating a measurement $(t_i, h_{\text{obs}, i})$ by our liquid level sensor, the forward model allows us to compute the \emph{likelihood function}. The likelihood function specifies the probability of observing a time series data set $\{(t_i, h_{\text{obs}, i})\}$ from our experiment conditioned upon proposed functions/values for the parameters $\alpha(h)$, $H$, $a_b$, $a_t$, $r_o$, $h_o$, $c$, and $h_0$. Thus, when any of these parameters are uncertain/unknown, the likelihood function quantifies the support that the time series data $\{(t_i, h_{\text{obs}, i})\}$ lend for each possible set of parameters.

\subsection{Forward model}
Suppose we fill our tank to an initial liquid height $h_0 \leq H$ [m], then at time $t=0$ [s] allow it drain through the orifice without further input of liquid. Fundamentally, the outflow is driven by gravity exerting a force on the water above the orifice, which creates a hydrostatic pressure in the water inside the tank at the entrance of the orifice. 
We wish to model the height of liquid in the tank as a function of time, $h=h(t)$, with $t$ [s] time. 

We assume the water at the top of the tank remains flat, allowed by a slow rate of discharge. We treat the water as incompressible (hence, constant density, $\rho$ [g/cm$^3$]) and inviscid. We do not attempt to explicitly model the flow streamlines inside the tank (as in Refs.~\cite{mathew2014numerical,sakri2017numerical}). (We omit $g$ from the parameter vector because we treat it as a constant known without uncertainty.)

\paragraph{Torricelli's law.}
Given the height of water in the tank is $h(t)$ [cm] at some time $t$, we model the velocity $v$ [cm/s] of the jet of water flowing out of the orifice with Torricelli's law \cite{d2021torricelli}:
\begin{equation}
	v\left(h(t) \right)=  \sqrt{2 g(h(t)-h_o)}, \label{eq:Torricelli}
\end{equation} where $g$ [cm/s$^2$] is the acceleration due to gravity. Torricelli's law follows from Bernoulli's equation \cite{welty2020fundamentals}, a mechanical energy balance on the flow through the orifice, treating (i) the flow as steady, plug, and frictional-lossless and (ii) the water as inviscid and incompressible.
An intuitive explanation of Torricelli's law is as follows. 
Conceptually, over a small time interval during draining, a small slice of liquid at the very top of the tank is removed and, concomitantly, an equivalent mass $m$ [g] of liquid is ejected from the orifice.
Gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. 
Torricelli's law equates the loss in potential energy of the system, $m g(h-h_o)$, with the kinetic energy gained, $m v^2/2$ \cite{groetsch1993inverse,driver1998torricelli,williams2021vessel}. 

\paragraph{Volumetric flow rate out of the tank.} Given the height of water in the tank is $h(t)$ at time $t$, we apply Torricelli's law in eqn.~\ref{eq:Torricelli} and model the volumetric flow rate of water out of the tank as:
\begin{equation}
	c \pi r_o^2 \sqrt{2 g(h(t)-h_o)}, \label{eq:outletflow}
\end{equation}
with $c\in(0,1)$ the [dimensionless] discharge coefficient to account for the vena contracta in the liquid jet, non-plug flow through the orifice, and frictional losses as the water flows through the orifice. 
Note, $c=1$ assumes the area of the liquid jet is equal to that of the orifice ($\pi r_o^2$), plug flow, and zero frictional losses.
Generally, the discharge coefficient depends on the rheology of the fluid, the geometry of the orifice, and, for laminar as opposed to turbulent flow, the Reynolds number of the flow \cite{teoman2022discharge}. 
\cite{horsch2020simple,teoman2022discharge,hicks2014determining,blasone2015discharge,lienhard1984velocity,wadhwa2021study}

\paragraph{Volume of water in the tank.} Given the height of water in the tank is $h(t)$ at time $t$, the volume $V$ of water inside the tank follows from the method of cross-sections in calculus \cite{debook}:
\begin{equation}
	V(h(t))=\int_0^{h(t)} \left(a(y) - \alpha(y) \right) dy, \label{eq:volume}
\end{equation}
where $a(y)-\alpha(y)$ is the cross-sectional area of water in the tank when the liquid level is $h=y$. Subtraction of the area of the object $\alpha(y)$ accounts for the displacement of water by the object inside the tank. 
(We neglect the small volume of liquid displaced by the level strip.)

\paragraph{Mass balance.} Application of the law of conservation of mass to the draining tank (the control volume) at time $t \geq 0$ equates the rate of deaccumulation of water in the tank [g/s] with the outflow rate [g/s] in expression \ref{eq:outletflow}:
\begin{equation}
	\overbrace{\diff{}{t} \Bigl( \rho V(h(t)) \Bigr )}^{\text{rate of accumulation}}= - \overbrace{\rho c \pi r_o^2 \sqrt{2 g(h(t)-h_o)}}^{\text{outflow rate}}
\end{equation}
Taking the derivative of $V(h(t))$ in eqn.~\ref{eq:volume} and using the chain rule \cite{debook} gives our forward model for $h(t)$:
%\begin{empheq}[box=\mybox]{align}
\begin{empheq}[box={\Garybox[forward model]}]{align}
& \left(a(h)-\alpha(h)\right) \diff{h}{t}= -c \pi r_o^2 \sqrt{2g (h(t)-h_o)}, \,\,\, t \geq 0 \label{eq:forward_model} \\
& h(0)=h_0, \nonumber
\end{empheq}
a [generally] nonlinear, first-order differential equation in $h(t)$ subject to an initial condition.
Given the tank and object geometry through $a(h)$ and $\alpha(h)$, the discharge coefficient $c$, the orifice radius and height $r_o$ and $h_o$, and initial height $h_0$, we may numerically solve the ODE in eqn.~\ref{eq:forward_model} (using e.g. \texttt{DifferentialEquations.jl} \cite{rackauckas2017differentialequations}) to predict the dynamics of the liquid level $h(t)$. 
I.e., this \emph{forward} model makes predictions of the effect/system output $h(t)$ when given the causal factors/system inputs.

A remark on a regime of model invalidity: because the radius of our orifice $r_o$ is small, surface tension prevents water from flowing out of the orifice when $h- h_o$ is small and yet positive. In this regime, Torricelli's law and thus the forward model do not hold.

\paragraph{Parameterization of $\alpha(h)$.}
We parameterize the area of the object inside the tank as a function of height, $\alpha(h)$, with a list of $n$ discrete evaluations of $\alpha(h)$ on a uniform grid of points on its domain:
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol \alpha := [\alpha_b, \alpha_t, ... \alpha_n]
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_i :=\alpha(i H/n)$. Then, we represent $\alpha(h)$ via linear interpolation of these values.

\paragraph{Parameter vector.} The dynamics of $h(t)$ depend on the system inputs/ causal factors/ \emph{parameters} that we stack into a vector:
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol \theta := [h_{\text{max}}, a_b, a_t, \alpha_b, ..., \alpha_n , r_o, h_o, h_0, c].
\end{equation}
The parameter vector $\boldsymbol \theta \in \mathbb{R}^{n+7}$ characterize the geometry of the tank, the object inside the tank, and the orifice; the initial state of the system; and the rheology of the liquid in the system (embedded in $c$). Consequently, we may write $h(t; \boldsymbol \theta)$ to explicitly indicate the dependence of $h(t)$ on the parameter vector $\boldsymbol \theta$. 

\subsection{Measurement model}
Suppose at time $t$ our liquid level sensor measures the height of liquid in the tank, giving us a data point $(t, h_{\text{obs}})$ (obs for ``observation''). 
To capture the [unobservable] noise corrupting the measurement, we treat the measured liquid level $h_{\text{obs}}$ as a realization of a random variable $H_{\text{obs}}$:
\begin{equation}
	H_{\text{obs}} = h(t; \boldsymbol \theta)  + \Psi,
\end{equation}
with the random variable $\Psi \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ the unobservable noise. 
We model the noise as additive to the model prediction $h(t; \boldsymbol \theta)$ from eqn.~\ref{eq:forward_model} and, among multiple measurements, independent and identically-distributed (IID) as a zero-mean Gaussian with variance $\sigma^2$. 
Therefore, the probability distribution governing the measured liquid level is a Gaussian of variance $\sigma^2$, centered at the model prediction $h(t;\boldsymbol \theta)$:
\begin{equation}
	H_{\text{obs}} \mid \boldsymbol  \theta, \sigma^2 \sim \mathcal{N}(h(t; \boldsymbol \theta), \sigma^2). \label{eq:H_obs_distn}
\end{equation} Importantly, the probability distribution of $H_{\text{obs}}$ is conditioned upon both the parameter vector $\boldsymbol  \theta$ and the variance $\sigma^2$ of the noise.

% TODO: plot residuals
% TODO expand 

Note, our measurement model neglects the possibility of model discrepancy \cite{brynjarsdottir2014learning,kennedy2001bayesian}, a difference between the true dynamics of the liquid level in the tank and the model $h(t)$ with the best-fit parameters/functions. In other words, we assume our forward model is capable of capturing the true $h(t)$ function without bias.


\subsection{Likelihood function}
The likelihood is the probability density of observing time series data \thedata given model parameters $\boldsymbol \theta$ and noise variance $\sigma^2$. Once the data are collected, the likelihood is instead viewed as a function of $\boldsymbol \theta$ and $\sigma^2$, quantifying the support that the data lend for the proposed parameter vector $\boldsymbol \theta$ and noise variance $\sigma^2$. Based on eqn.~\ref{eq:H_obs_distn} and the IID assumption, the likelihood function is:
\begin{equation}
 \pi_{\text{like}}(\thedatanomath \mid \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 ) = \prod_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp \left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{h_{\text{obs}, i} - h(t_i; \boldsymbol\theta)}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right]. \label{eq:like}
\end{equation}

\section{Bayesian statistical inversion}
Our first objective is to leverage tank drainage time series data \thedata, without a solid object inside the tank, to calibrate the forward model in eqn.~\ref{eq:forward_model}---an inverse problem of parameter inference where the discharge coefficient $c$ is the primary unknown.
Subsequently, our second objective is to leverage the calibrated forward model and tank drainage data \thedata to infer the shape of a heavy, solid object inside of the tank---an inverse problem of reconstruction where $\boldsymbol \alpha$, the area of the object at a set of heights, is the primary unknown. 

We sequentially tackle both of these inverse problems with Bayesian statistical inversion \cite{calvetti2018inverse,waqar2023tutorial,kaipio2006statistical} to allow incorporation of prior information into the solution and quantify uncertainty in the solution.
To capture our uncertainty about the parameter vector $\boldsymbol \theta$ and noise variance $\sigma^2$, we treat them as random variables $\boldsymbol \Theta$ and $\boldsymbol \Sigma^2$ and model their probability distributions. Bayesian statistical inversion follows three stages:

\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\paragraph{Stage 1: express our prior beliefs and information about the unknowns via a prior distribution.}
First, we specify a prior probability density $\pi_{\text{pr}}(\boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2)$ expressing our beliefs about the values of the parameter vector $\boldsymbol \theta$ and noise variance $\sigma^2$ before we conduct a tank-drainage experiment.
Our beliefs encoded into the prior may be strongly grounded in information/data/measurements, but also have some degree of subjectivity.
The prior can range from diffuse (e.g. a uniform distribution) to informative (e.g. a Gaussian with a small variance). \cite{van2021bayesian}

\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\paragraph{Stage 2: conduct an experiment to gather data containing information about the unknowns.}
Next, we conduct a tank-drainage experiment (with or without a solid object inside of it, see Sec.~\ref{sec:expt}) to gather time series data characterizing the dynamics of the liquid level, \thedata. When this data are considered against the forward model, the data provide new information about the parameter vector $\boldsymbol \Theta$ and noise variance $\Sigma^2$.

\vspace{-\baselineskip}
\paragraph{Stage 3: update the prior to a posterior distribution in light of the data.}
Finally, we update the prior to a posterior probability density $\pi_{\text{post}}(\boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 \mid \thedatanomath)$ in light of the data \thedata we collected. 
The posterior density follows from the likelihood function in eqn.~\ref{eq:like} and prior density via Bayes's theorem \cite{van2021bayesian,calvetti2018inverse}:
\begin{equation}
	\pi_{\text{post}}(\boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 \mid \thedatanomath) = \frac{
	\pi_{\text{like}}(\thedatanomath \mid \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 ) 
	\pi_{\text{pr}}(\boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2)
	}{
	\pi_{\text{ev}}(\thedatanomath) 
	}, \label{eq:post}
\end{equation} where the denominator, the \emph{evidence}, is the marginal likelihood:
\begin{equation}
    \pi_{\text{ev}}(\thedatanomath) = \int_0^\infty \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n+7}} \pi_{\text{like}}(\thedatanomath \mid \boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 )  
	\pi_{\text{pr}}(\boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2)  d \boldsymbol\theta d\sigma^2 \label{eq:ev}
\end{equation}
that can in principle be computed from the likelihood and prior in the numerator. 

\paragraph{The posterior distribution is the raw solution to the inverse problem.}
The posterior probability density of the parameter vector, with the noise variance marginalized out, $\pi_{\text{post}}(\boldsymbol\theta):= \int_0^\infty \pi_{\text{post}}(\boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 \mid \thedatanomath) d\sigma^2$ is the raw, uncertainty-quantifying solution to the inverse problem.
The posterior density $\pi_{\text{post}}(\boldsymbol\theta)$ expresses the state of our knowledge about the parameter vector $\boldsymbol \theta$ in light of the experimental tank drainage data \thedata when compared with the forward and measurement models. Assuming the forward and measurement models and prior assumptions hold, the parameter vector $\boldsymbol \theta$ plausibly belongs to the region of parameter space containing the bulk of the posterior density, and the spread of the posterior over parameter space quantifies our uncertainty about the parameter vector. 
From the posterior, we may derive a credible interval for each unknown parameter. E.g., the 95\% equal-tailed credible interval for a parameter contains 95\% of the posterior density with equal-area tails omitted on both sides. 
Considering $\pi_{\text{post}}(\boldsymbol\theta)$ in conjunction with the forward model, we can make probabilistic predictions, such as ``what is the probability that a draining tank with initial measured liquid level $h_{0, \text{obs}}$ reaches a liquid level $h^\prime$ before a time $t^\prime$?''.

\paragraph{Sampling from the posterior distribution.} We resort to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to obtain samples from the posterior density $\pi_{\text{post}}(\boldsymbol \theta, \sigma^2 \mid \thedatanomath)$ in eqn.~\ref{eq:post}. Advantageously, MCMC samplers do not require us to compute the evidence $\pi_{\text{ev}}(\thedatanomath)$ in eqn.~\ref{eq:ev}, a high-dimensional integral. Specifically, we employ the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) \cite{hoffman2014no} implemented in \texttt{Turing.jl} \cite{ge2018turing}. From the samples of parameter vectors from the posterior, we may draw empirical posterior distributions (histograms) and compute credible intervals.


\section{Results}
We now test the efficacy of our forward and measurement model for tackling an inverse problem of reconstruction: inferring the shape of a solid, heavy object inside of a gravity-driven tank from measurements of the liquid level in the tank over time. 
First, we calibrate our forward and measurement model using data from a drainage experiment where the tank does not contain a solid object.

\subsection{Prior distributions on the tank and orifice geometry}
For both model calibration and the reconstruction problem, we employ the same prior distributions for the geometry of the tank and the orifice, informed by length-measurements and the reported drill bit diameter.

We use a measuring tape to make length-measurements of the dimensions of the tank, giving estimates for the area of the rounded rectangle forming the top and bottom of the tank, $a_{t, \text{obs}}=129.9$\,cm and $a_{b, \text{obs}}=103.0$\,cm, and the height of the tank, $h_{\text{max, obs}}=28.6$\,cm, appearing in $a(h)$ in eqn.~\ref{eq:a_of_h}. We also measure the height of the orifice in the side of the tank, $h_{o, \text{obs}}=0.9$\,cm. We model our uncertainty about the tank and orifice geometry by treating $A_t$, $A_b$, $H_{\text{max}}$, $H_o$ as random variables and imposing informative prior distributions on them, centered at our measurements of them:
\begin{align}
A_t &\sim \mathcal{N}(a_{t, \text{obs}}, \sigma_\ell^2) \\
A_b &\sim \mathcal{N}(a_{b, \text{obs}}, \sigma_\ell^2) \\
H_{\text{max}} &\sim \mathcal{N}(h_{\text{max}, \text{obs}}, \sigma_\ell^2) \\
H_o &\sim \mathcal{N}(h_{o, \text{obs}}, \sigma_\ell^2),
\end{align}
where $\sigma_\ell=0.1$\,cm is the assumed standard deviation of our length measurements based on the markings on our measurement tape.

For the radius of the orifice, we impose the informative prior distribution:
\begin{equation}
r_o \sim \mathcal{N}(r_{o, \text{obs}}, \sigma_d^2),
\end{equation}
with $r_{o, \text{obs}}=0.1$\,cm based on the diameter (5/64\,in) of the drill bit we used to drill the orifice in the tank, reported by the manufacturer of the drill bit. We assume a standard deviation of $\sigma_d= 0.001$\,cm to account for uncertainty in the drill bit radius and translation into orifice radius during drilling.

\subsection{Phase I: Bayesian calibration of the dynamic model of the liquid level}
First, we calibrate our forward and measurement models in eqn.~\ref{eq:forward_model} and \ref{eq:H_obs_distn} through conducting a tank drainage experiment when an solid, heavy object is certainly not present inside the tank.

\section{Conclusions and Discussion}

Calibrate first. then can infer shape.

Rocks inside tank. infer type of rock, coupled with packing. Popcorn polymer.

Surface tension dominates keeping the liquid from exiting. Then Torricelli's law not valid. Liquid stops emptyhing slightly above the hole. 

basis functions for a(h), instead of point by point, but prior harder to interpret.
